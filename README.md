# Test Data Set

A collection of bone measurements (in CSV format) and associated code for matching analysis (in R).

## Measurements used in this study (Buikstra & Ubelaker 1994)


Measurement | Definition
--- | --- 
Humerus: Maximum Length (HML) | Direct distance from the most superior point on the head of the humerus to the most inferior point on the trochlea
Humerus: Epicondylar Breadth (HEB) | Distance of the most laterally protruding part of the lateral epicondyle from the corresponding projection of the medial epicondyle
Humerus: Head Diameter (HHD) | Direct distance between the most superior and inferior points on the border of the articular surface
Radius: Maximum Length (RML) | Distance from the most proximally positioned point on the head of the radius to the tip of the styloid process without regard for the long axis of the bone
Radius: Medial-lateral Diameter (RMLD) | Distance between medial and lateral surfaces at midshaft
Radius: Anterior- Posterior Diameter at Midshaft (RAPD) | Distance between anterior and posterior surfaces at midshaft
Femur: Maximum Length (FML) | Distance from the most superior point on the head of the femur to the most inferior point on the distal condyles
Femur: Maximum Bicondylar Length (FBL) | Distance from the most superior point on the head of the femur to a plane drawn along the inferior surfaces of the distal condyles.
Femur: Epicondylar Breadth (FEB) | Distance between the two most laterally projecting points on the epicondyles
Femur: Head Diameter (FHD) | The maximum diameter of the femur head
Femur: Medial-Lateral Midshaft Diameter (FMLD) | Distance between the medial and lateral surfaces at midshaft
Femur: Anterior-Posterior Midshaft Diameter (FAPD) | Distance between the anterior and posterior surfaces at the midshaft
Tibia: Maximum Length (TML.Gold)* | The maximum length of the tibia, taken from the most superior point of the intercondylar eminence to the most distal aspect of the medial malleolus
Tibia: Maximum Length (TML) | Distance from the superior articular surface of the lateral condyle to the tip of the medial malleolus
Tibia: Maximum Proximal Epiphyseal Breadth (TPB) | Maximum distance between the two most laterally projection points on the medial and lateral condyles of the proximal articular region
Tibia: Medial-Lateral Diameter at the Midshaft (TMLD) | Straight line distance of the medial margin from the interosseous crest at the level of the midshaft
Tibia: Anterior-Posterior Diameter at the Midshaft (T APD)* | Distance between the anterior and posterior surfaces at the midshaft, when the calipers are perpendicular to the forward-facing tibia

*Additional measurement not taken from Buikstra & Ubelaker (1994). Taken, instead, from the measurement guide in the Goldman Osteometric Data Set (https://web.utk.edu/~auerbach/GoldMeasures.pdf)
